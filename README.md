# Predicting-Diabetes
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model for predicting diabetes. The model utilizes various features such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and more to classify patients as either having diabetes or not.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is publicly available. It contains medical records of Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, including various diagnostic measurements.

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn Â  

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset file (e.g., diabetes.csv).
src: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models: Stores trained models.
notebooks: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
